    <h2>What is gRPC?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>gRPC</strong> is a modern, open-source Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework developed by Google. It enables communication between services in a distributed system by allowing clients to directly call methods on a server as if it were a local object. gRPC supports multiple programming languages and is highly efficient, making it a popular choice for microservices architectures.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features of gRPC:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Efficient Communication:</strong> gRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport, providing features like multiplexing, bidirectional streaming, flow control, and header compression.</li>
        <li><strong>Protocol Buffers:</strong> gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for defining service methods and serializing data, which is faster and more compact than JSON or XML.</li>
        <li><strong>Language-agnostic:</strong> gRPC provides cross-platform support for many programming languages, such as Go, Java, C++, Python, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Streaming:</strong> gRPC supports client-side, server-side, and bidirectional streaming, enabling real-time data exchange between clients and servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Definition:</strong> gRPC services are defined using Protobuf files (.proto), making the interface clear and strongly typed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Core Concepts of gRPC:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Unary RPC:</code> The simplest form of communication where the client sends a single request and receives a single response.</li>
        <li><code>Server Streaming RPC:</code> The server sends a stream of responses after receiving a client request.</li>
        <li><code>Client Streaming RPC:</code> The client sends a stream of requests, and the server responds once all the requests are received.</li>
        <li><code>Bidirectional Streaming RPC:</code> Both client and server send streams of messages in both directions, allowing for continuous data flow.</li>
    </ul>
