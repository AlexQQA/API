    <h2>What is GraphQL?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>GraphQL</strong> is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system that you define for your data. Unlike REST, where you have fixed endpoints returning predefined data structures, GraphQL allows the client to specify exactly what data it needs, making APIs more flexible and efficient.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features of GraphQL:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Declarative Data Fetching:</strong> Clients request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.</li>
        <li><strong>Single Endpoint:</strong> GraphQL APIs expose a single endpoint for all queries and mutations, simplifying the structure compared to multiple REST endpoints.</li>
        <li><strong>Strongly Typed Schema:</strong> A GraphQL API has a schema that defines types and their relationships, ensuring the structure of the queries matches the schema.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> With <code>subscriptions</code>, GraphQL can enable real-time updates for clients when data changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Version-Free API:</strong> GraphQL eliminates the need for API versioning, as clients can request exactly what they need, and new fields can be added without breaking existing functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Core Concepts of GraphQL:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Queries</code> - Requests for data from the server. You can request exactly the fields and objects you need.</li>
        <li><code>Mutations</code> - Used to modify data on the server (creating, updating, or deleting resources).</li>
        <li><code>Subscriptions</code> - Real-time data fetches, allowing clients to receive updates when data changes.</li>
    </ul>
